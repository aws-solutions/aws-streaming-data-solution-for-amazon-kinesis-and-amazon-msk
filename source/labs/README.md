## Amazon MSK Labs

The AWS CDK assets in this folder are not published on the [solution landing page](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/aws-streaming-data-solution-for-amazon-msk/) because they are developed for use with the [Amazon MSK Labs](https://amazonmsk-labs.workshop.aws/en/).

Amazon MSK Labs are a learning resource for getting started with Amazon MSK. The Labs include a use case example for ingesting and analyzing real-time clickstream data, and best practices for migrating your self-managed Apache Kafka cluster to Amazon MSK.

The Labs explain how to leverage advanced Amazon MSK features (such as [Cruise Control](https://amazonmsk-labs.workshop.aws/en/cruisecontrol/overview.html), [TLS mutual authentication](https://amazonmsk-labs.workshop.aws/en/securityencryption/tlsmauth.html), and [open monitoring](https://amazonmsk-labs.workshop.aws/en/openmonitoring/overview.html)). You can apply these features to clusters created using the AWS Steaming Data Solution for MSK.

> **Note**: These Labs are usually featured in workshops where AWS accounts are provided by the workshop host, but you can deploy them into your personal AWS account without attending a workshop. We recommend launching the Labs in a development environment with admin privileges.
